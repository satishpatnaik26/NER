Client Account Transfer Form
MERRILL
Use this form to transfer all or a portion of your account from
another financial institution to your Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith Incorporated (“Merrill Lynch”) account.
For best results, please complete the information requested below in parts 1 to 4 using ALL CAPITAL letters and
black ink. If you need more room for information or signatures, use a copy of the relevant page or a blank sheet. Use
one form for each account that you're transferring.
Things to know before you begin:
Many firms transfer assets using an automated transfer process, which typically takes 5 to 6 business days. Other
firms either don't use the automated process or must process some assets manually, which takes more time. The
following estimated time frames for manual transfers are from the date of receipt of instructions by the deli
firm and may vary greatly:
· Equities, bonds and options, approximately 15 business days
Restricted securities, approximately 15 to 20 business days
Mutual funds, up to 30 business days
- Foreign securities, 4 to 6 weeks
Note: Annuities are not transferred using this form. Please use the Merrill Lynch Annuity Transfer Form.
Remember to update any automatic deposits or withdrawals you've set up on the account you're transferring to
Merrill Lynch.
• Some transfers may result in tax consequences, penalties or financial risk. Consult your tax and financial
professionals before requesting this transfer.
If you're rolling over assets from a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, consider all of your choices. You may
be able to roll over to an IRA, roll over an old 401(k) to a 401(k) at a new employer, take a distribution or leave the
account where it is, depending on your unique financial needs and retirement goals. Each choice may offer different
benefits and limitations including investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required
minimum distributions, tax treatment and protection from creditors and legal judgments. Additionally, there are
limits to how often and when you can roll over your account. Please contact your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored
plan administrator for help with the transfer.

Use this form to transfer all or a portion of your account from
another financial institution to your Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith Incorporated (“Merrill Lynch”) account.
For best results, please complete the information requested below in parts 1 to 4 using ALL CAPITAL letters and

one form for each account that you're transferring.
Things to know before you begin:
Many firms transfer assets using an automated transfer process, which typically takes 5 to 6 business days. Other
firms either don't use the automated process or must process some assets manually, which takes more time. The
following estimated time frames for manual transfers are from the date of receipt of instructions by the deli
firm and may vary greatly:
· Equities, bonds and options, approximately 15 business days
Restricted securities, approximately 15 to 20 business days
Mutual funds, up to 30 business days
- Foreign securities, 4 to 6 weeks
Note: Annuities are not transferred using this form. Please use the Merrill Lynch Annuity Transfer Form.
Remember to update any automatic deposits or withdrawals you've set up on the account you're transferring to
Merrill Lynch.
• Some transfers may result in tax consequences, penalties or financial risk. Consult your tax and financial
professionals before requesting this transfer.
If you're rolling over assets from a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, consider all of your choices. You may
be able to roll over to an IRA, roll over an old 401(k) to a 401(k) at a new employer, take a distribution or leave the
account where it is, depending on your unique financial needs and retirement goals. Each choice may offer different
benefits and limitations including investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required
minimum distributions, tax treatment and protection from creditors and legal judgments. Additionally, there are
limits to how often and when you can roll over your account. Please contact your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored
plan administrator for help with the transfer.
